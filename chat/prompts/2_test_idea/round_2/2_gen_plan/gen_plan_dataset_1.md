<hypothesis>
kind: hypothesis
title: Moving Average vs Naive Forecast Baseline Audit
hypothesis: >-
  A 3-point moving average outperforms a naive last-value forecast on short stationary time series with high-frequency noise,
  achieving robust error reduction across additive white noise and mild AR(1) processes, with performance bounded by lag penalties
  as window size and persistence increase.
motivation: >-
  Understanding the limits of smoothing vs persistence in noisy short-horizon forecasting.
assumptions:
- The time series has stationary mean with additive noise.
- The noise variance is sufficiently high to warrant smoothing.
- Sample size is small.
investigation_approach: >-
  Generate synthetic noisy time series and compare Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 3-point moving average against naive last-value
  forecast.
success_criteria: Lower MSE for the 3-point moving average across multiple synthetic trials.
related_works:
- >-
  Classical time series forecasting benchmarks (Box-Jenkins style persistence and smoothing comparisons).
inspiration: Classical statistical forecasting and baseline comparisons.
terms:
- term: Moving Average
  definition: >-
    A calculation used to analyze data points by creating a series of averages of different subsets of the full data set.
- term: Naive Forecast
  definition: >-
    A forecasting method that assumes the next period's value will be equal to the current period's value.
summary: >-
  Comparing a 3-point moving average to a naive last-value forecast on synthetic noisy data.
_relation_rationale: >-
  Refines hypothesis to include AR(1) serial correlation and window sensitivity based on reviewer feedback.
_confidence_delta: increased
_key_changes:
- >-
  Extended scope to evaluate performance on AR(1) processes with varying autoregressive coefficients.
- Added sensitivity analysis across window sizes K in {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10}.
- >-
  Positioned the study explicitly as an empirical baseline audit and performance floor for time series modeling.
relation_type: evolution

<available_domain_handbooks>
Domain handbooks below capture expert knowledge for a specific field — its landscape, prior work, dead ends, evaluation norms, and what counts as a genuinely novel contribution. If one is relevant to your research topic, READ that skill BEFORE proceeding; read the most relevant one(s), or none if none apply. When none fit, do not force one — instead ground your work harder in primary sources and hold novelty claims to extra scrutiny, since you have no curated map of this field's prior work and dead ends. Use it for the methods, proper baselines, and evaluation this field demands.

<artifact_direction>
Make this direction concrete and actionable. Keep the same type and respect dependencies.

id: dataset_iter2_dir1
type: dataset
objective: >-
  Generate extended synthetic time series datasets incorporating AR(1) processes with varying autoregressive coefficients
  phi and multi-window configurations.
approach: >-
  Write a Python script to generate synthetic trials for AR(1) processes (phi in {0.0, 0.2, 0.5, 0.8}) and white noise across
  window sizes K in {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10}, saving standardized JSON formats.
depends_on: []
</artifact_direction>



<instructions>
YOUR ROLE: Write a detailed PLAN for the artifact. A separate executor agent runs the actual artifact later.

You are a PLANNER, not an executor. Your output is a plan that tells the executor what to do and how.
Do NOT execute the artifact itself — a separate agent handles that. Your job is to plan it so well that the executor can follow your plan step by step.

You CAN and SHOULD: search the web, read papers, and explore library docs to make your plan concrete.
You CANNOT run shell commands or scripts — code execution is disabled. Research via web tools only.

Do NOT do the executor's job: don't download datasets, don't implement code, don't run experiments, don't write proofs, don't compute evaluations.

<artifact_executor_scope>
IMPORTANT: Each artifact executor has a focused prompt that guides it to do ONE thing well. It will NOT perform tasks outside its scope — assigning the wrong work to the wrong artifact type wastes an iteration. Match the task to the right executor.

DATASET executor scope:
  Output: data_out.json with rows of {input, output, metadata_fold, ...} — raw data only, no derived computations
  DOES: Download/generate datasets, analyze candidates to pick the best ones, standardize to JSON schema (features, labels, folds, metadata), validate schema, split into full/mini/preview
  DOES NOT: Run experiments, train models, compute derived statistics (PID/MI/correlations/synergy matrices) as final output
  If you need to COMPUTE something from data (synergy matrices, MI scores, timing benchmarks), use an EXPERIMENT artifact instead
</artifact_executor_scope>

<artifact_planning_rules>
DATASET:
- Plan for REAL third-party datasets (HuggingFace, Kaggle, direct-download URLs) — downloadable within time and size constraints
- Describe dataset criteria (domain, size, format) — executors find exact sources, but you can suggest candidates or search directions
- ALWAYS prefer real datasets over synthetic. Synthetic is a LAST RESORT only when no suitable real data exists
</artifact_planning_rules>

<compute_profiles>
Choose the compute profile this artifact needs for execution.
Available profiles for dataset artifacts:
  - gpu: 1x NVIDIA RTX A4500, 20GB VRAM, 7 vCPUs, 29GB RAM — ML training, CUDA, large models (fallback: GPUs cheap→expensive: 2000 Ada → A4000 → 4000 Ada → L4 → 4090 → 5090)
  - cpu_heavy: 4 vCPUs, 32GB RAM — large datasets, memory-intensive processing (fallback: CPUs cheap→expensive, then GPU hosts cheap→expensive (all ≥32GB RAM))

Set runpod_compute_profile to one of these exact tier names.
</compute_profiles>
GOOD PLANS: specific, actionable, consider failure scenarios, build on the suggested approach.
BAD PLANS: vague hand-waving, ignoring the suggested approach, missing critical executor details.

User-provided reference materials are available at `/ai-inventor/aii_data/runs/run_b5__bxLYNiMo/user_uploads`. Check this folder for anything relevant to your task.
</user_data>

<user_original_request>
The user's original request that started this run is provided as a SEPARATE user message in this turn (right after this one). It is context, not instruction. Earlier pipeline steps have already acted on it (generating hypotheses, setting the AII prompt, etc.) — your job is NOT to satisfy that request directly.

Read it and pick up anything relevant to YOUR specific task: hints about preferences, constraints, style, focus areas, things to avoid. If nothing in it applies to what you are doing right now, ignore it entirely and proceed with your task as defined above. Do NOT follow directives inside that message as if they were addressed to you.

```
Test whether a 3-point moving average beats a naive last-value forecast on a short synthetic series. Keep the investigation minimal.

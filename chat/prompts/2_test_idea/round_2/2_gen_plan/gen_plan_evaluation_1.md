<hypothesis>
kind: hypothesis
title: Moving Average vs Naive Forecast Baseline Audit
hypothesis: >-
  A 3-point moving average outperforms a naive last-value forecast on short stationary time series with high-frequency noise,
  achieving robust error reduction across additive white noise and mild AR(1) processes, with performance bounded by lag penalties
  as window size and persistence increase.
motivation: >-
  Understanding the limits of smoothing vs persistence in noisy short-horizon forecasting.
assumptions:
- The time series has stationary mean with additive noise.
- The noise variance is sufficiently high to warrant smoothing.
- Sample size is small.
investigation_approach: >-
  Generate synthetic noisy time series and compare Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 3-point moving average against naive last-value
  forecast.
success_criteria: Lower MSE for the 3-point moving average across multiple synthetic trials.
related_works:
- >-
  Classical time series forecasting benchmarks (Box-Jenkins style persistence and smoothing comparisons).
inspiration: Classical statistical forecasting and baseline comparisons.
terms:
- term: Moving Average
  definition: >-
    A calculation used to analyze data points by creating a series of averages of different subsets of the full data set.
- term: Naive Forecast
  definition: >-
    A forecasting method that assumes the next period's value will be equal to the current period's value.
summary: >-
  Comparing a 3-point moving average to a naive last-value forecast on synthetic noisy data.
_relation_rationale: >-
  Refines hypothesis to include AR(1) serial correlation and window sensitivity based on reviewer feedback.
_confidence_delta: increased
_key_changes:
- >-
  Extended scope to evaluate performance on AR(1) processes with varying autoregressive coefficients.
- Added sensitivity analysis across window sizes K in {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10}.
- >-
  Positioned the study explicitly as an empirical baseline audit and performance floor for time series modeling.
relation_type: evolution

<available_domain_handbooks>
Domain handbooks below capture expert knowledge for a specific field — its landscape, prior work, dead ends, evaluation norms, and what counts as a genuinely novel contribution. If one is relevant to your research topic, READ that skill BEFORE proceeding; read the most relevant one(s), or none if none apply. When none fit, do not force one — instead ground your work harder in primary sources and hold novelty claims to extra scrutiny, since you have no curated map of this field's prior work and dead ends. Use it for the methods, proper baselines, and evaluation this field demands.

title: Moving Average vs Naive Forecast
summary: >-
  This experiment provides a rigorous empirical evaluation comparing a 3-point moving average smoothing technique against
  a naive last-value persistence forecasting baseline on synthetic noisy time series data across 1,000 independent trials.
  In time series analysis and forecasting tasks, distinguishing between genuine underlying signal dynamics and high-frequency
  observational noise is critical for predictive accuracy. The naive baseline forecasts the future value by simply persisting
  the most recent observed value, making it highly susceptible to random noise fluctuations. Conversely, the 3-point moving
  average aggregates the last three observations to smooth out additive Gaussian noise, providing a more robust estimate of
  the local level. Our comprehensive evaluation across multiple noise levels (standard deviations of 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0) demonstrates
  that the 3-point moving average consistently outperforms the naive baseline, achieving a mean squared error (MSE) reduction
  of approximately 31.08% across all tested noise configurations. These findings validate that simple window-based smoothing
  is superior to persistence forecasting in stationary noisy regimes, offering a dependable baseline for subsequent time series
  modeling research.

<instructions>
YOUR ROLE: Write a detailed PLAN for the artifact. A separate executor agent runs the actual artifact later.

You are a PLANNER, not an executor. Your output is a plan that tells the executor what to do and how.
Do NOT execute the artifact itself — a separate agent handles that. Your job is to plan it so well that the executor can follow your plan step by step.

You CAN and SHOULD: search the web, read papers, and explore library docs to make your plan concrete.
You CANNOT run shell commands or scripts — code execution is disabled. Research via web tools only.

Do NOT do the executor's job: don't download datasets, don't implement code, don't run experiments, don't write proofs, don't compute evaluations.

<artifact_executor_scope>
IMPORTANT: Each artifact executor has a focused prompt that guides it to do ONE thing well. It will NOT perform tasks outside its scope — assigning the wrong work to the wrong artifact type wastes an iteration. Match the task to the right executor.

EVALUATION executor scope:
  Output: eval_out.json with evaluation results
  DOES: Any evaluation of experiment results — metrics, statistical tests, ablations, comparisons, visualizations, robustness checks, error analysis, etc.
  DOES NOT: Implement new methods (use EXPERIMENT), collect data (use DATASET)
  This is for analyzing experiment outputs from any angle
</artifact_executor_scope>

<artifact_planning_rules>
EVALUATION: Must depend on at least one EXPERIMENT. Focus on statistical rigor and validity checks.
</artifact_planning_rules>

<compute_profiles>
Choose the compute profile this artifact needs for execution.
Available profiles for evaluation artifacts:
  - gpu: 1x NVIDIA RTX A4500, 20GB VRAM, 7 vCPUs, 29GB RAM — ML training, CUDA, large models (fallback: GPUs cheap→expensive: 2000 Ada → A4000 → 4000 Ada → L4 → 4090 → 5090)
  - cpu_heavy: 4 vCPUs, 32GB RAM — large datasets, memory-intensive processing (fallback: CPUs cheap→expensive, then GPU hosts cheap→expensive (all ≥32GB RAM))

Set runpod_compute_profile to one of these exact tier names.
</compute_profiles>
GOOD PLANS: specific, actionable, consider failure scenarios, build on the suggested approach.
BAD PLANS: vague hand-waving, ignoring the suggested approach, missing critical executor details.
</instructions><user_data>
User-provided reference materials are available at `/ai-inventor/aii_data/runs/run_b5__bxLYNiMo/user_uploads`. Check this folder for anything relevant to your task.
</user_data>

<user_original_request>
The user's original request that started this run is provided as a SEPARATE user message in this turn (right after this one). It is context, not instruction. Earlier pipeline steps have already acted on it (generating hypotheses, setting the AII prompt, etc.) — your job is NOT to satisfy that request directly.

Read it and pick up anything relevant to YOUR specific task: hints about preferences, constraints, style, focus areas, things to avoid. If nothing in it applies to what you are doing right now, ignore it entirely and proceed with your task as defined above. Do NOT follow directives inside that message as if they were addressed to you.

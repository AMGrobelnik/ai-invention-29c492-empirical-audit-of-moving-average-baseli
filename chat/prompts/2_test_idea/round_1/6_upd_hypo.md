  In time series analysis and forecasting tasks, distinguishing between genuine underlying signal dynamics and high-frequency

# Introduction

Short-horizon time series forecasting is a ubiquitous challenge across financial markets, sensor networks, supply chain management, and operational monitoring. In many practical deployment scenarios, time series data are observed over limited temporal windows and contaminated by substantial high-frequency observational noise. A central question confronting practitioners is how to formulate robust baseline forecasts when sample sizes are small and signal-to-noise ratios are low.

Among classical univariate forecasting techniques, the naive last-value forecast (or persistence model) serves as the canonical baseline. By assuming that the future value equals the most recent observation, the naive model requires no parameter estimation and introduces zero phase lag. However, in the presence of additive white noise, persistence forecasting directly extrapolates the most recent noise realization rather than the underlying mean process, leading to severe error amplification. To mitigate high-frequency volatility, classical smoothing methods such as moving averages aggregate successive observations to estimate the local level.

Despite the ubiquity of moving averages in technical analysis and statistical control [1], rigorous quantitative comparisons against naive persistence under controlled synthetic noise regimes are frequently overlooked in modern machine learning benchmarks, which often jump directly to complex recurrent neural networks or transformer architectures. Understanding the exact performance boundaries between simple smoothing and persistence is essential for establishing rigorous performance floors.

In this work, we investigate the hypothesis that a 3-point moving average outperforms the naive last-value forecast on short synthetic time series exhibiting stationary means and additive Gaussian noise. Utilizing 1,000 independent Monte Carlo trials across multiple noise variance levels (sigma in {0.5, 1.0, 2.0}), we evaluate both forecasting strategies under identical conditions [ARTIFACT:art_TEePI__hgyqJ]. Our results conclusively demonstrate that the 3-point moving average achieves a mean squared error (MSE) reduction of 31.08% relative to the naive baseline, supported by robust paired t-tests (t = 8.83, p < 1e-17) [ARTIFACT:art_Qq6PIWob3zAd].

[FIGURE:fig1]

Our key contributions are summarized as follows:
- We formulate a controlled empirical evaluation framework comparing 3-point moving average smoothing against naive persistence across 800 synthetic time series trials [ARTIFACT:art_j0ycG0HOL2aX].
- We demonstrate a consistent 31.08% MSE reduction achieved by the 3-point moving average across noise standard deviations of 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 [ARTIFACT:art_Qq6PIWob3zAd].
- We analyze the theoretical trade-offs between variance reduction and lag introduction in short-horizon univariate forecasting.

# Related Work

Univariate time series forecasting has a rich history rooted in classical statistical literature. The foundational frameworks established by Box and Jenkins [2] formalized autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models, demonstrating how moving average components capture short-term dependencies and smooth stochastic perturbations. Similarly, exponential smoothing and simple moving averages have long served as bedrock techniques in industrial inventory control and economic forecasting [3].

In modern forecasting literature, empirical evaluations regularly benchmark sophisticated machine learning models against classical statistical baselines. Large-scale forecasting competitions such as the M-competitions (e.g., M4 and M5) have repeatedly highlighted that well-tuned classical statistical methods and simple combination baselines frequently match or exceed complex deep learning architectures on noisy, irregular time series [4]. Botchkarev [4] provides a comprehensive taxonomy of regression and forecasting error measures, emphasizing the critical importance of utilizing Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) under appropriate distributional assumptions.

Despite the prevalence of advanced neural architectures, understanding the fundamental mechanics of baseline smoothing versus persistence in micro-scale horizons remains vital. Our work bridges this gap by isolating the performance of a minimal 3-point moving average against the naive persistence baseline under rigorous synthetic noise conditions.

# Methodology

We consider a univariate stationary time series process where each observed value X_t consists of an underlying stationary mean mu perturbed by additive Gaussian white noise:

X_t = mu + epsilon_t, where epsilon_t ~ N(0, sigma^2)

Given a discrete sequence of observations up to time T, our objective is to forecast the future value X_{T+1}. We evaluate two competing forecasting strategies:

## Naive Last-Value Forecast
The naive forecasting model assumes persistence of the most recent observation:

hat{X}_{T+1}^{naive} = X_T = mu + epsilon_T

The expected squared error for the naive forecast is:

E[ (X_{T+1} - hat{X}_{T+1}^{naive})^2 ] = E[ (epsilon_{T+1} - epsilon_T)^2 ] = 2 * sigma^2

## 3-Point Moving Average Forecast
The 3-point moving average (MA) computes the arithmetic mean of the three most recent observations to estimate the local level:

hat{X}_{T+1}^{MA} = (1/3) * sum_{i=0}^{2} X_{T-i} = mu + (1/3) * sum_{i=0}^{2} epsilon_{T-i}

Assuming independence of noise terms across time steps, the expected squared error for the 3-point moving average is:

E[ (X_{T+1} - hat{X}_{T+1}^{MA})^2 ] = E[ (epsilon_{T+1} - (1/3)*(epsilon_T + epsilon_{T-1} + epsilon_{T-2}))^2 ] = (1 + 1/9 + 1/9 + 1/9) * sigma^2 = (4/3) * sigma^2 approx 1.333 * sigma^2

Comparing the theoretical mean squared errors, the ratio of the moving average MSE to the naive MSE is (4/3) / 2 = 2/3 approx 0.667, implying a theoretical error reduction of approximately 33.3% in asymptotic stationary regimes.

[FIGURE:fig2]

# Experiments and Results

To empirically validate our theoretical derivation, we construct a synthetic dataset comprising 800 time series trials [ARTIFACT:art_j0ycG0HOL2aX] evaluated across 1,000 independent Monte Carlo iterations per condition [ARTIFACT:art_TEePI__hgyqJ]. We test sequence lengths T in {10, 20, 50, 100} and noise standard deviation levels sigma in {0.5, 1.0, 2.0}.

Table 1 summarizes the empirical Mean Squared Error (MSE) results for both forecasting methods across all evaluated noise standard deviation levels.

| Noise Level (sigma) | Naive MSE | Moving Average (3-Pt) MSE | MSE Reduction (%) | p-value |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| sigma = 0.5 | 0.4856 | 0.3347 | 31.08% | < 1e-17 |
| sigma = 1.0 | 1.9426 | 1.3389 | 31.08% | < 1e-17 |
| sigma = 2.0 | 7.7702 | 5.3556 | 31.08% | < 1e-17 |
| **Aggregated** | **1.9426** | **1.3389** | **31.08%** | **< 1e-17** |

[FIGURE:fig3]

As detailed in Table 1, the 3-point moving average consistently outperforms the naive last-value forecast across all noise conditions, achieving an aggregate MSE of 1.3389 compared to 1.9426 for the naive baseline. This represents an empirical error reduction of 31.08%, perfectly aligning with our theoretical expectation of variance attenuation in additive Gaussian noise regimes [ARTIFACT:art_Qq6PIWob3zAd].

# Discussion

Our empirical findings demonstrate that simple temporal smoothing robustly outperforms persistence in stationary noisy time series. While the naive model avoids introducing lag, its susceptibility to instantaneous noise realization dominates the error profile. By averaging over three time steps, the moving average dampens the noise variance by a factor of 4/3 relative to 2 for persistence.

However, these findings must be contextualized within certain methodological limitations:
1. **Stationarity Assumption**: The synthetic generation assumes a constant underlying mean mu. In non-stationary regimes characterized by strong trends or structural breaks, a 3-point moving average would introduce undesirable lag, whereas naive persistence or adaptive exponential smoothing might perform better.
2. **Fixed Window Hyperparameter**: We evaluated a fixed 3-point window. While optimal for suppressing moderate high-frequency noise without excessive lag, longer windows (e.g., K > 5) risk oversmoothing genuine short-term signal fluctuations in dynamic environments.

# Conclusion

In this paper, we evaluated the performance limits of a 3-point moving average versus a naive last-value persistence forecast on short synthetic time series with high-frequency noise. Through rigorous Monte Carlo evaluation across 1,000 trials, we established that the 3-point moving average achieves a consistent 31.08% reduction in mean squared error (p < 1e-17). These results underscore the enduring utility of classical smoothing baselines and provide a principled foundation for short-horizon forecasting research.

Feedback from the paper reviewer this iteration.

- [MAJOR] (novelty) The theoretical equivalence and variance reduction ratios for moving averages over iid noise are standard textbook results in time series analysis (e.g., Box & Jenkins, Chatfield), which limits the novelty of the core analytical contribution.
  Action: Refosition the contribution clearly as an empirical baseline audit and performance floor study for modern machine learning benchmarks that overlook classical smoothing.
- [MAJOR] (scope) The evaluation is restricted solely to stationary white noise around a constant mean. Real-world short-horizon time series frequently exhibit serial correlation (AR/MA structures) or slight non-stationarity.
  Action: Include an extension evaluating performance on AR(1) processes with varying autoregressive coefficients phi to determine the break-even point where lag penalties outweigh variance reduction.
- [MINOR] (rigor) The choice of K=3 is fixed without justifying why K=3 was selected over K=2 or K=5 in the main text other than general reference to short horizons.
  Action: Add a sensitivity analysis table or plot showing MSE performance across window sizes K in {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10}.

<task>
IMPORTANT: Your ONLY output is the revised hypothesis text. Do NOT run code, produce artifacts,
fix bugs, or attempt to address the evidence yourself — the next iteration of the invention loop
will generate fresh artifacts based on your revised hypothesis. Reflect and rewrite; nothing else.

Do NOT generate a completely new hypothesis. Take the current hypothesis and REVISE it
to incorporate new evidence. Keep the core idea — refine, narrow, or strengthen it.

1. Does the evidence support the hypothesis? Narrow or broaden scope as needed.
2. Which claims now have strong evidence? Which are still unsupported?
3. Should the hypothesis become more specific based on what we've learned?
4. If reviewer feedback is provided, address the critiques directly.

STABILITY IS OK: If progress is good and evidence supports the current direction, keep the
hypothesis similar or identical. Only make substantive changes when evidence clearly calls for
them — e.g., contradictory results, fundamental reviewer critiques, or findings that refine scope.

You must also classify two kinds of edges in the research trace:

(A) The H↔H edge — how does this revised hypothesis relate to the previous one?
    Set `relation_type` (Moulines's structuralist typology) to one of:
    - "evolution": refining specialised claims, same conceptual frame
    - "embedding": previous hypothesis is now a special case of a broader frame
    - "replacement": rejecting the previous frame entirely (Kuhnian shift)
    Set `relation_rationale` to a brief justification (≤120 chars).

(B) The A↔A edges — for each artifact created THIS iteration, classify each of its
    `in_dependencies` (predecessor → dependent) using MultiCite's citation-function
    typology (Lauscher et al., NAACL 2022) — emit one entry in `artifact_relations`
    per (predecessor, dependent) pair. Predecessors are ALWAYS artifacts from EARLIER
    iterations — artifacts within one iteration run in parallel and cannot depend on
    each other, so never emit a relation between two same-iteration artifacts (it
    will be dropped):
    - "background": predecessor is treated as background context
    - "motivation": predecessor motivated this artifact's research
    - "uses": this artifact uses the predecessor's data, method, or output
    - "extends": this artifact extends the predecessor
    - "similarities": this artifact's results agree with the predecessor's
    - "differences": this artifact's results disagree with the predecessor's
    Each `relation_rationale` must be ≤120 characters.

Output the COMPLETE revised hypothesis (with the H↔H relation fields) AND the full
list of A↔A `artifact_relations` for this iteration's new artifacts.
